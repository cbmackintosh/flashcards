**About:**
FlashCards is a simple study app playable using basic keyboard controls through the command line interface. The app allows coding students to test their knowlege of a variety of different programming topics. The app provides the user with feedback indicating whether or not they answered the question correctly, as well as what percentage of all the questions were answered correctly and how long it took the user to work through all questions. Incorrectly answered questions are automatically recycled so that the user has an opportunity to answer them again.
